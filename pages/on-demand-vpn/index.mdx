Given the amount of geo-restricted content on the internet these days, it can be nice to be able to reach for a VPN whenever you might need one.
Paying for a subscription to a VPN service is one way to do this, but if you, like me, 
find your VPN needs to be very sporatic, then a subscription model probably doesn't feel like the right way to go.

Today I would like to go over my solution to this, which is to use a SOCKS proxy to a cloud VM instead.
Instead of paying a monthly subscription, this means that you only pay as much as you use it.
For light to medium video streaming, this will most likely be below $1/month.

To get started, make sure that you have a Google Cloud account with valid billing info and a project set up. 
If not, you can make one [here](https://cloud.google.com/).

After that install [Google Cloud SDK for OS X](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart-mac-os-x) and follow their guide to get it initialized.
Make sure you select the compute engine zone which corresponds to the country you'd like to have your VM in. You can find a list of the compute engine zones and their locations [here](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/regions-zones#available).

What we now want to do can be summarized in the following steps:

1. Create a micro VM
2. Set up an SSH tunnel to it
3. Tell OS X to use this tunnel as a SOCKS proxy
4. Wait for the user to finish using the tunnel
5. Tear everything down

Using the SDK and some native OS X commands, we can turn all of this into a handle little script, which you can find below:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

trap ' ' INT

echo "Initializing..."

# Start the VPN instance
gcloud compute instances create \
  tmp-vpn \
  --machine-type f1-micro

# Set up the SSH tunnel and activate proxy
# Sleep a bit first to make sure that the SSH connection is up before the proxy is enabled
(sleep 5; networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxy Wi-Fi localhost 4242) & \
gcloud compute ssh tmp-vpn \
  --strict-host-key-checking=no \
  --command="echo \"VPN activated. Press Ctrl+C to exit.\" && tail -f /dev/null" \
  -- -D 4242

echo "Cleaning up..."

# Deactivate SOCKS proxy
networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate Wi-Fi off

# Delete the VPN instance
gcloud compute instances delete \
  tmp-vpn

echo "Cleanup complete."
```

As you can see, there isn't really anything to it, 
so applying a similar approach to another cloud provider should be pretty straight forward.
While it does take a little bit of time to set up the connection and later tear down the VM, 
we now have ourselves a very cost-effective on demand VPN.

Enjoy!
